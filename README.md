# üíé **Diamond Price Prediction** üè∑Ô∏è

This project is focused on predicting the price of diamonds based on various features like **carat weight**, **cut quality**, **color**, **clarity**, and other attributes. By applying machine learning models, we aim to predict the price of a diamond using its characteristics, providing valuable insights into what influences diamond pricing.

## üîç **Project Overview**

The primary goal of this project is to create a machine-learning model capable of predicting diamond prices. The dataset includes various diamond characteristics, and multiple regression models are trained and evaluated to select the best one based on the R¬≤ score. The **Decision Tree Regressor** was found to be the best performing model for this task.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Technologies Used**

- **Python 3.x**
- Libraries:
  - `numpy` - For numerical operations
  - `pandas` - For data manipulation and analysis
  - `scikit-learn` - For machine learning models and model evaluation
  - `matplotlib` & `seaborn` - For data visualization
  - `joblib` - For model serialization
- Machine Learning Algorithms:
  - **Linear Regression**
  - **Lasso Regression**
  - **Ridge Regression**
  - **ElasticNet Regression**
  - **Decision Tree Regressor** *(Best Performing Model)*
 
## üîñDataset
The diamond_data.csv file contains information about diamonds, including the following features:
- Carat
- Cut
- Color
- Clarity
- Price (target variable)

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Model Training**

To train the model, simply run the training script, which evaluates multiple regression models and selects the best one based on the R¬≤ score. In this case, the **Decision Tree Regressor** was selected as the best model based on performance.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Making Predictions**

Once the model is trained, you can use it to predict the price of a diamond based on new input data.

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Model Evaluation**

The project evaluates different regression models using various performance metrics to select the most accurate model. The following evaluation metrics were used:

- **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error):** Measures the average magnitude of the error in the model's predictions.
- **MAE (Mean Absolute Error):** Provides the average absolute difference between predicted and actual values.
- **R¬≤ Score:** Indicates how well the model explains the variance in the target variable.
